This manuscript is part of the special issue ‘Climate change adaptation needs a science of culture,’ published in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B in 2023.


### Description of the file structure

The repository includes R code files to simulate and analyse harvest trip data, and Stan files to reproduce the patch choice model and the harvest success model. 

The R code file also contains information on prerequisites, and code sections to generate and save model summaries (table) and visualisations used in the manuscript.
